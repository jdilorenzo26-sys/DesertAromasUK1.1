      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Our Story</h1>
      <p className="opacity-80">We’re two lifelong friends brought together by a shared passion for fine fragrances. 
    For years, we’ve been captivated by the rich and timeless scents of the Middle East — but found ourselves frustrated at how difficult and expensive it was to enjoy them here in the UK.
What started as a personal journey has grown into Desert Aromas: a brand built on the belief that luxury fragrances should be accessible without compromise. By working closely with trusted distributors across the Middle East and beyond, we bring the latest releases and beloved classics to the UK at fair, honest prices.
Our mission is simple: to share the fragrances we love, at the quality you expect, without the inflated costs. Whether it’s discovering new launches at the same time as the rest of the world, or enjoying timeless scents that never fade, we’re here to make every bottle feel special.
Desert Aromas isn’t just about perfume — it’s about passion, authenticity, and a promise to keep the art of fragrance within reach.</p>
